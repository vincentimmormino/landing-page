          Kasane Teto is a Japanese and English UTAU originally created as an April Fool's
          joke in 2008. To this day, many people mistakenly refer to Kasane Teto as a Vocaloid.
          Despite her origins, Kasane Teto has remained a popular and beloved character since
          her creation. In April 2023, Kasane Teto received an AI voicebank in Synthesizer V.

        <p class="intro-text">
          Despite being an UTAU, Kasane Teto has appeared in multiple Project Diva games, which
          is largely why she is often mistaken for a Vocaloid. There were attempts to create a
          Vocaloid voicebank for Kasane Teto, but they ultimately were not released due to the
          issues with the voicebank's quality. Kasane Teto finally saw commercial release with
          Synthesizer V, with an AI voicebank that sounds impressively realistic while maintaining
          much of her unique tone that makes her voice so appealing.
