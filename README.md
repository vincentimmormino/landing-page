# landing-page
In this project, I have coded a website landing page based on a layout selected
by The Odin Project. I was only provided a picture of the layout, so I had to
code it entirely myself. We were encouraged to get creative and tweak things, so
I had fun with this!

I'd say the biggest challenge I faced working on this page was horizontal scaling.
I didn't even realize I had an issue with horizontal scaling until I opened inspect
element and everything broke! Lesson learned, always double check that your site
doesn't break at different resolutions and aspect ratios. I fixed this issue by
changing most declared heights to minimum heights, so that each section could grow
taller to fit its content if need be. I also set a max-height for the introduction
text, so that after a certain point it would stop growing and simply overflow with
a scrollbar. I just didn't like how it looked otherwise, because it'd become way
taller than the image beside it as the viewport got thinner.

I had fun with this, and I'm happy with how it came out! I may revisit this later to
try to make my code more efficient, because I know it certainly can be cleaned up,
but I am satisfied with my work for now.
